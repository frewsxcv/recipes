# slow cooker vegetable curry with tofu

## ingredients

- 16oz extra firm tofu, drained and pressed
- 1-14.5oz can lite coconut milk (or full fat)
- 1 cup vegetable broth
- ¼ cup Thai green curry paste (or red)
- 1 tbsp fresh minced ginger
- ½ tsp turmeric
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tbsp coconut sugar
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 1½ cups sliced bell pepper (I used frozen)
- ¾ cup peas
- 1 small eggplant, chopped
- Brown rice or quinoa, for serving (optional)

## steps

1. Remove tofu from package and drain water. Place in tofu press and tighten knobs until the tofu is snug. Place tofu press on a plate or baking sheet to catch liquid. Press for 30 minutes to an hour, tightening knobs as needed. (If you don't have a tofu press, place tofu between paper towels or a kitchen towel. Place on plate and cover with heavy objects, like a couple books. Allow tofu to press for 30 minutes to an hour.)
1. While tofu presses, add coconut milk, vegetable broth, green curry paste, ginger, turmeric, salt, and coconut sugar to the slow cooker. Whisk until well combined.
1. Add onion, bell pepper, peas, and eggplant, stirring to combine. Cook on high for 3-4 hours.
1. While the mixture is cooking, heat a large pan sprayed with olive oil spray over medium heat. Dice up the pressed tofu into bite-sized pieces. Cook tofu for a few minutes per side, or until golden. Set aside for later.
1. When the curry has 30 minutes left to cook, add the cooked tofu. Allow curry and tofu to cook for the remaining 30 minutes and serve over brown rice or quinoa if desired.
