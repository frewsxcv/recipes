1. Press the Manual button and then the + or - button to choose 12 minutes. The pot may take 10 minutes or so to come to pressure.
1. When the cooking cycle ends, let the IP go into Natural Release phase by letting it sit undisturbed for 15-20 minutes.
1. Turn off the pot and manually release the remaining pressure. When the pin in the lid drops, and it is safe to remove the lid, do so carefully, facing it away from your face.
