# slow cooker potato leek soup

## ingredients

- 1 pound Yukon gold potatoes, peeled and diced
- 12 ounces sliced fresh or frozen leeks, white and light green parts only (from 4 leeks)
- 4 cups low-sodium vegetable broth
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
- 1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme leaves, plus extra for serving
- 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground white or black pepper
- 1/4 cup sour cream, plus extra for serving

## steps

1. Place the potatoes, leeks, broth, butter, salt, thyme, and pepper in a 3- to 4-quart slow cooker and stir to combine.
1. Cover and cook on the LOW setting until potatoes are very tender, about 8 hours.
1. Blend the soup with an immersion blender until smooth. (Alternatively, transfer the vegetables, in batches, to a stand blender. Blend on low speed until smooth. Return the blended soup to the slow cooker.)
1. Add the sour cream and whisk to combine. Ladle into bowls and serve with an extra swirl of sour cream and a sprinkle of chopped fresh thyme.
